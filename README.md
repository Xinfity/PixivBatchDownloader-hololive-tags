# [PixivBatchDownloader](https://github.com/xuejianxianzun/PixivBatchDownloader) hololive tags

This list aims to provide most (if not all) of the tags that are put on hololive illustrations on pixiv.

Note that tags are case insensitive in the downloader and trailing commas are automatically removed when entered.

## Order

One of these will always be the first in line:
* Main/most popular tag
* Official fan art tag given by the hololive talent, e.g. "#絵フブキ" for Fubuki fan art; "#gawrt" for Gura fan art

These will always be second if possible:
* English translation of the main/most popular tag if it's in Japanese
* English translation of the official fan art tag given by the hololive talent if it's in Japanese

The rest are any other variations, which also follow some rules:
* The non-spaced variation should precede the spaced variation
* A spaced variation should be followed by an underscored variation
